# String-Sequence-UsingFullSatck

We have String of light with 100 bulbs in it , 1st bulb is green , 2nd is red and 3rd is blue , and it repeats in that order for whole string. I want to lit up all Greens first ,then all Reds and then all blues and again repeat with all Greens, all Reds and all Blues. Write a program to implement this behavior using React JS, Spring boot, REST API, Functional interfaces, Lambda functions, Java 8 stream to achieve the solution.
